 - Add back button to High Scores Menu
 - Fix snake movement
    - If two keys are pressed in quick succession the button
        press is largely ignored by the program.  It will
        probably be beneficial to implement some form of 
        queue which will read the next move each game loop
        and only carry out that move if it is legal.  The
        keyboard interrupts will simply be adding values to
        this queue.

 - Settings 
    - ugh
    - All values in the 'settings' dictionary in main.py
        should be editable with a toggle switch or switching
        list.
